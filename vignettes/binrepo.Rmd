Binary packages for fast installation via `AnVIL::install()` for Bioconductor
and CRAN packages are available at through a `CRAN`-style repository at
`https://storage.googleapis.com/bioconductor-packages/3.15/container-binaries/`. The packages are
generated with the internal Bioconductor package,
[BiocKubeInstall](https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocKubeInstall), which
parallelizes package installation and binary creation on a Kubernetes cluster
using Google Kubernetes Engine. The clusters runs and deploys builds Tuesday,
Thursdays, and Saturday through a scheduled Github Action. See the [BiocKubeInstall
Documentation](https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocKubeInstall) for more information.

BiocKubeInstall works with [mtmorgan/RedisParam](https://github.com/mtmorgan/RedisParam),
which facilitations parallelization over a Kubernetes cluster. Docker images for
`bioc-redis:manager` and a release worker e.g `bioc-redis:RELEASE_3_14` are on DockerHub.
