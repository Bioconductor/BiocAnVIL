## Binary package installation (under development)

- Because the software environment is fixed by the container, packages
  can be pre-built and rapidly installed simply by copying from an
  online repository. We are developing the tooling to support this
  repository (as folders in google buckets) and to facilitate easy
  installation (via the `AnVIL::install()` function).
