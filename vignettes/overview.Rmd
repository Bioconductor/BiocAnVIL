## About _Bioconductor_ and _AnVIL_

[_Bioconductor_][] is a successful open-source project for the
statistical analysis and comprehension of high throughput genomic
data. _Bioconductor_ is based on the _R_ programming language. It
consists of more than 1600 [_R_ packages][] contributed by more than
1000 maintainers world-wide. _Bioconductor_ packages are downloaded to 1/2
million IP addresses annually. There are more than 29,000
[PubMedCentral citations][] to _Bioconductor_. _Bioconductor_ has an
active [support site][] and [community slack][].

[_AnVIL_][] is a US National Institutes of Health / National Human
Genome Research Institute initiative to develop a Genomic Data Science
Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL).

_AnVIL_ provides the ability to launch RStudio, Jupyter notebook, and
other _R_ / _Bioconductor_ resources in a computational cloud. The
_AnVIL_ environment provides secure access to large-scale as well as
individual data resources, and to scalable cloud-based computational
environments.
