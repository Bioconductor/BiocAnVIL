## Updating the Website

1. `git clone` the repository.
2. If editing content, edit the `.Rmd` file in `vignettes` directory. Or to
make a new article, add the new `.Rmd` file in `vignettes` directory. `pkgdown`
will automatically generate a link to the article in the navigation. To edit
the navigation, edit the `_pkgdown.yml` file.
3. `git push` your new branch to the repository. 
4. Push to `main` or open a pull request to the `main` branch to trigger the
pkgdown action to rebuild the site.

## Customizations

The navigation can be customized by editing the `_pkgdown.yml` and custom css
may be added by editing `pkgdown/extra.css`.
